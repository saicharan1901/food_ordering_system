<h1> A Simple Food Ordering System using Socket Programming </h1>

<p>
The current system is a basic restaurant ordering system where the client
displays the menu, prompts the user to place an order, sends the order to
the server, and receives the total cost from the server. However, the
system is built using TCP connection, which may not be optimal for real
time communication due to its connection-oriented nature.
<p>


To Run the Code:- 

Start by moving to the directory where server.py and client.py files are present and run

``` python server.py ``` <br>
          or  <br>
``` python3 server.py ```

After running the server.py file, run the client.py file 

``` python client.py ``` <br>
          or                  <br>
``` python3 client.py ```
